You can use the Windows Task Scheduler to create an event that runs "IPSCAN.bat" every hour. Here's the command in Windows Command Prompt (DOS) to do this:

```cmd
schtasks /create /tn "IPScanTask" /tr "F:\Desktop\IP Scan\IPSCAN.bat" /sc hourly /st 00:00 /f
```

### Explanation:
- `/create`: This creates a new scheduled task.
- `/tn "IPScanTask"`: Assigns the name "IPScanTask" to the scheduled task.
- `/tr "F:\Desktop\IP Scan\IPSCAN.bat"`: Specifies the path to the batch file to be executed.
- `/sc hourly`: Sets the task to run every hour.
- `/st 00:00`: The start time for the task (you can modify the time as needed).
- `/f`: Forces the creation of the task, overwriting any existing task with the same name.

Run this command in Command Prompt with administrator privileges to successfully schedule the task.
