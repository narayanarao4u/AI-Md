write windows dos netsh command to create user ITAdmin and password Vizagit@123 and this user must be hidden.
And also enable remote desktop
---
To achieve the goals of creating a hidden user and enabling Remote Desktop on a Windows system using `netsh` and other commands, you'll need to use a combination of commands. Note that the `netsh` command is used for network configuration and doesn't directly handle user management or Remote Desktop settings. Instead, you'll use `net user` for creating users, `wmic` for hiding users, and PowerShell for enabling Remote Desktop. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide:

1. **Create the user**:
   Open Command Prompt as an administrator and run:
   ```cmd
   net user ITAdmin Vizagit@123 /add
   ```

2. **Set the user to be hidden**:
   To hide the user from the login screen, you can modify the registry using PowerShell or `reg` commands. In Command Prompt or PowerShell, use:
   ```cmd
   reg add "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon\SpecialAccounts\UserList" /v ITAdmin /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f
   ```

3. **Enable Remote Desktop**:
   Open PowerShell as an administrator and run:
   ```powershell
   Set-ItemProperty -Path 'HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Terminal Server' -Name 'fDenyTSConnections' -Value 0
   ```

4. **Allow Remote Desktop through the firewall**:
   Still in PowerShell, run:
   ```powershell
   Enable-NetFirewallRule -DisplayGroup "Remote Desktop"
   ```

5. **(Optional) Add the user to the Remote Desktop Users group**:
   If you want the `ITAdmin` user to have permissions to connect via Remote Desktop, you need to add them to the "Remote Desktop Users" group. Run:
   ```cmd
   net localgroup "Remote Desktop Users" ITAdmin /add
   ```

### Summary

1. **Create User**:
   ```cmd
   net user ITAdmin Vizagit@123 /add
   ```

2. **Hide User**:
   ```cmd
   reg add "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon\SpecialAccounts\UserList" /v ITAdmin /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f
   ```

3. **Enable Remote Desktop**:
   ```powershell
   Set-ItemProperty -Path 'HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Terminal Server' -Name 'fDenyTSConnections' -Value 0
   ```

4. **Allow Remote Desktop through Firewall**:
   ```powershell
   Enable-NetFirewallRule -DisplayGroup "Remote Desktop"
   ```

5. **Add User to Remote Desktop Users Group**:
   ```cmd
   net localgroup "Remote Desktop Users" ITAdmin /add
   ```

This setup ensures that the `ITAdmin` user is created with the specified password, hidden from the login screen, and has Remote Desktop enabled.

it is possible to create batch to perform all those operations
---
Yes, you can create a batch file to perform all these operations. Since some commands need to be run with elevated privileges, you'll need to run the batch file as an administrator. Below is a batch file that combines the steps:

```batch
@echo off
:: Create ITAdmin user
net user ITAdmin Vizagit@123 /add

:: Hide ITAdmin user from login screen
reg add "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon\SpecialAccounts\UserList" /v ITAdmin /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f

:: Enable Remote Desktop
powershell -Command "Set-ItemProperty -Path 'HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Terminal Server' -Name 'fDenyTSConnections' -Value 0"

:: Allow Remote Desktop through the firewall
powershell -Command "Enable-NetFirewallRule -DisplayGroup 'Remote Desktop'"

:: Add ITAdmin user to Remote Desktop Users group
net localgroup "Remote Desktop Users" ITAdmin /add

echo All tasks completed successfully.
pause
```

### Instructions

1. **Save the Batch File**:
   Save the above script as a `.bat` file, for example, `setupITAdmin.bat`.

2. **Run as Administrator**:
   Right-click the `.bat` file and select "Run as administrator" to ensure that all commands have the necessary permissions.

### Explanation

- **Create ITAdmin User**: Uses `net user` to create the new user with the specified password.
- **Hide User**: Uses `reg add` to modify the registry and hide the user from the login screen.
- **Enable Remote Desktop**: Uses `powershell -Command` to set a registry key to allow Remote Desktop connections.
- **Allow Remote Desktop Through Firewall**: Uses `powershell -Command` to enable firewall rules for Remote Desktop.
- **Add User to Remote Desktop Users Group**: Uses `net localgroup` to add the user to the Remote Desktop Users group.

This batch file assumes that PowerShell is available and that you have administrative privileges to execute these commands. If PowerShell is not available or you want to use a different method for enabling Remote Desktop, you would need to modify the script accordingly.
