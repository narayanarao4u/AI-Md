# uploaded file is output of show running configuration command of my Cisco routor Give me the command for to block device with MAC ID E8:80:88:D1:7D:83 and 00:00:5A:11:80:C7

To block devices with MAC addresses `E8:80:88:D1:7D:83` and `00:00:5A:11:80:C7` on your Cisco router, you can use the following commands:

1. Enter the interface configuration mode for the relevant interface (e.g., FastEthernet3/1):
   ```
   VMCDR# configure terminal
   VMCDR(config)# interface FastEthernet3/1
   ```

2. Apply a MAC address access list:
   ```
   VMCDR(config-if)# mac access-list extended BLOCK-MAC
   VMCDR(config-ext-nacl)# deny host E8:80:88:D1:7D:83 any
   VMCDR(config-ext-nacl)# deny host 00:00:5A:11:80:C7 any
   VMCDR(config-ext-nacl)# permit any any
   ```

3. Apply the MAC address access list to the interface:
   ```
   VMCDR(config-if)# mac access-group BLOCK-MAC in
   ```

4. Exit the configuration mode and save the changes:
   ```
   VMCDR(config-if)# exit
   VMCDR(config)# end
   VMCDR# write memory
   ```

These commands will block the devices with the specified MAC addresses from communicating on the specified interface. Be sure to apply the MAC access list to the correct interface where the devices are connected.

# give the command to block ip address 10.34.130.41 
To block the IP address `10.34.130.41` on your Cisco router, you can follow these steps:

1. Enter global configuration mode:
   ```
   VMCDR# configure terminal
   ```

2. Create an access list that denies traffic from the IP address `10.34.130.41`:
   ```
   VMCDR(config)# ip access-list standard BLOCK-IP
   VMCDR(config-std-nacl)# deny   10.34.130.41
   VMCDR(config-std-nacl)# permit any
   ```

3. Apply the access list to the relevant interface in the inbound or outbound direction:
   - For example, to block traffic coming into the router on `FastEthernet3/1`:
     ```
     VMCDR(config)# interface FastEthernet3/1
     VMCDR(config-if)# ip access-group BLOCK-IP in
     ```

4. Exit configuration mode and save the configuration:
   ```
   VMCDR(config-if)# exit
   VMCDR(config)# end
   VMCDR# write memory
   ```

This will block all traffic from the IP address `10.34.130.41` on the specified interface. Adjust the interface and direction (`in` or `out`) based on where you need the block to apply.

# Block multiple IPs?
To block multiple IP addresses on your Cisco router, you can follow a similar process as blocking a single IP, but you'll add multiple `deny` statements to the access list. Here's how:

### Example: Blocking IPs `10.34.130.41`, `10.34.130.42`, and `10.34.130.43`

1. Enter global configuration mode:
   ```
   VMCDR# configure terminal
   ```

2. Create or modify the access list to block the multiple IPs:
   ```
   VMCDR(config)# ip access-list standard BLOCK-MULTIPLE-IPS
   VMCDR(config-std-nacl)# deny   10.34.130.41
   VMCDR(config-std-nacl)# deny   10.34.130.42
   VMCDR(config-std-nacl)# deny   10.34.130.43
   VMCDR(config-std-nacl)# permit any
   ```

3. Apply the access list to the relevant interface in the inbound or outbound direction:
   - For example, to block traffic coming into `FastEthernet3/1`:
     ```
     VMCDR(config)# interface FastEthernet3/1
     VMCDR(config-if)# ip access-group BLOCK-MULTIPLE-IPS in
     ```

4. Exit configuration mode and save the configuration:
   ```
   VMCDR(config-if)# exit
   VMCDR(config)# end
   VMCDR# write memory
   ```

### Explanation:
- The `deny` statements block traffic from the specified IP addresses.
- The `permit any` statement ensures that all other traffic is allowed.
- You can apply the access list to the appropriate interface in either the `inbound` or `outbound` direction based on your requirements.

This method allows you to block multiple IP addresses efficiently. Adjust the IPs and interfaces as needed for your network configuration.

# explain line no 407,408,409 in uploaded file
Lines 407, 408, and 409 in your uploaded Cisco router configuration file are as follows:

```
ip nat pool bsnl1 117.239.54.89 117.239.54.95 netmask 255.255.255.248
ip nat inside source list 2 pool bsnl1 overload
ip nat inside source list 3 pool bsnl1 overload
```

### Explanation:
1. **Line 407 (`ip nat pool bsnl1 117.239.54.89 117.239.54.95 netmask 255.255.255.248`):**
   - This command defines a **NAT pool** called `bsnl1`. 
   - The pool consists of the IP range from `117.239.54.89` to `117.239.54.95`, with a **netmask** of `255.255.255.248`.
   - **NAT (Network Address Translation)** allows multiple internal IP addresses (from inside the network) to be translated to public IP addresses, so they can communicate with external networks like the internet.

2. **Line 408 (`ip nat inside source list 2 pool bsnl1 overload`):**
   - This command links **Access Control List (ACL) 2** to the `bsnl1` NAT pool for **overloading**.
   - **Overload** means that **PAT (Port Address Translation)** is being used, which allows multiple internal IP addresses to share the same public IP (from the pool) by mapping different internal ports to different external ports.
   - All the internal IP addresses that match **ACL 2** will be translated using the public IPs in the `bsnl1` pool.

3. **Line 409 (`ip nat inside source list 3 pool bsnl1 overload`):**
   - Similar to line 408, this command links **Access Control List (ACL) 3** to the same `bsnl1` NAT pool for **overloading**.
   - All the internal IP addresses that match **ACL 3** will also be translated using the public IPs in the `bsnl1` pool, using PAT.

### Summary:
- These commands are configuring **NAT (Network Address Translation)**, specifically **PAT (Port Address Translation)**, which allows multiple devices on the internal network to use the same set of public IP addresses (from the pool `bsnl1`) when accessing external networks, like the internet.
- The ACLs (2 and 3) are used to specify which internal IP addresses are eligible for translation using this NAT pool.

# is it possible to add and two Access Control List to that 

Yes, you can add multiple Access Control Lists (ACLs) to the NAT configuration on a Cisco router. However, each ACL would need to be applied separately, as in your current configuration where both **ACL 2** and **ACL 3** are linked to the same NAT pool.

If you want to add two more ACLs (for example, **ACL 4** and **ACL 5**) to the same NAT pool (`bsnl1`), you can follow the same approach used for **ACL 2** and **ACL 3**.

### Example of Adding Two More ACLs:

1. **Define new ACLs (if not already defined)**:
   You can create new ACLs to specify the additional internal IP ranges you want to allow NAT for.
   ```
   ip access-list standard 4
   permit 10.34.140.0 0.0.0.255
   !
   ip access-list standard 5
   permit 10.34.150.0 0.0.0.255
   ```

2. **Add the new ACLs to the NAT pool**:
   You would link the new ACLs (4 and 5) to the same NAT pool (`bsnl1`) using the `ip nat inside` command with **overload**.
   ```
   ip nat inside source list 4 pool bsnl1 overload
   ip nat inside source list 5 pool bsnl1 overload
   ```

### Resulting NAT Configuration:
After adding ACLs 4 and 5, your configuration would look like this:

```
ip nat pool bsnl1 117.239.54.89 117.239.54.95 netmask 255.255.255.248
ip nat inside source list 2 pool bsnl1 overload
ip nat inside source list 3 pool bsnl1 overload
ip nat inside source list 4 pool bsnl1 overload
ip nat inside source list 5 pool bsnl1 overload
```

### What This Does:
- **ACL 2** and **ACL 3** will continue to define which internal IP ranges are eligible for NAT.
- **ACL 4** and **ACL 5** will allow additional internal IP ranges to be translated using the same NAT pool (`bsnl1`).
- **Overload** ensures that multiple internal IPs can share the same public IPs using **PAT** (Port Address Translation).

In short, you can add as many ACLs as necessary to the NAT configuration, as long as each is linked individually to the NAT pool.

# How to verify NAT?

To verify that NAT (Network Address Translation) is working correctly on your Cisco router, you can use several commands that provide information about the NAT translations, NAT statistics, and active sessions. Here are the most commonly used verification commands:

### 1. **View Active NAT Translations**

You can check the current NAT translations on your router using the following command:

```bash
show ip nat translations
```

This command will display a table with the following information:
- **Inside Local**: The private IP address of the device in your network.
- **Inside Global**: The public IP address assigned to the device.
- **Outside Local/Global**: The IP address of the external device or website being accessed.

Example output:
```
Pro Inside global     Inside local      Outside local      Outside global
tcp 117.239.54.90     10.34.128.2       192.0.2.10         192.0.2.10
tcp 117.239.54.91     10.34.128.3       198.51.100.5       198.51.100.5
```

This shows that devices with local IPs `10.34.128.2` and `10.34.128.3` are translated to global IPs `117.239.54.90` and `117.239.54.91` when accessing external networks.

### 2. **Check NAT Statistics**

You can view NAT statistics to understand how many translations are active and how many packets have been translated.

```bash
show ip nat statistics
```

Example output:
```
Total active translations: 5 (3 static, 2 dynamic; 4 extended)
Outside interfaces: FastEthernet3/15
Inside interfaces: FastEthernet3/1
Hits: 10546  Misses: 24
Expired translations: 102
Dynamic mappings:
-- Inside Source
[Id: 2] access-list 2 pool bsnl1 refcount 2
pool bsnl1: netmask 255.255.255.248
    start 117.239.54.89 end 117.239.54.95
    type: nat-pool, total addresses: 7, allocated: 2 (28%), misses: 0
```

This output provides the following information:
- **Total active translations**: Number of currently active NAT translations.
- **Hits**: The number of times packets were successfully translated.
- **Misses**: The number of times packets couldn't be translated (possibly due to no available IP).
- **Dynamic mappings**: Shows which ACLs or interfaces are linked to NAT pools.

### 3. **Verify Specific NAT Entries**

You can specify a protocol, inside local, or inside global address to see particular NAT translations. For example, to check if a specific IP has been translated:

```bash
show ip nat translations | include 10.34.128.2
```

This filters the NAT translations and only shows entries involving the IP address `10.34.128.2`.

### 4. **Debug NAT Operations (Advanced)**

For real-time troubleshooting, you can enable NAT debugging, but this is typically done with caution in production environments because it generates a lot of output.

```bash
debug ip nat
```

To stop debugging, use:

```bash
undebug all
```

### 5. **Show NAT Configuration**

To verify your NAT configuration, including the NAT pool, ACLs, and interfaces involved, you can use:

```bash
show running-config | include ip nat
```

This will show all `ip nat` related commands in your running configuration.

### Example Output:
```
ip nat pool bsnl1 117.239.54.89 117.239.54.95 netmask 255.255.255.248
ip nat inside source list 2 pool bsnl1 overload
ip nat inside source list 3 pool bsnl1 overload
```

### Summary of Key Commands:
- `show ip nat translations`: View active NAT translations.
- `show ip nat statistics`: View NAT translation statistics.
- `show ip nat translations | include <IP>`: Filter NAT translations for a specific IP.
- `debug ip nat`: Enable real-time NAT debugging (for troubleshooting).
- `show running-config | include ip nat`: View NAT-related configuration.

These commands help you monitor, verify, and troubleshoot NAT operations on your Cisco router.
 
# explain line no 552 and 553 in the uploaded file

Lines 552 and 553 in your uploaded Cisco router configuration file are as follows:

```
ip access-list standard blockIP
deny   10.0.0.0 0.255.255.255
permit any
```

### Explanation:

1. **Line 552: `ip access-list standard blockIP`**
   - This command is used to create a **standard access control list (ACL)** named `blockIP`.
   - **Standard ACLs** are used to filter traffic based only on the **source IP address**.
   - In this case, the ACL `blockIP` will define rules to either permit or deny traffic based on the source IP addresses.

2. **Line 553: `deny   10.0.0.0 0.255.255.255`**
   - This command adds a rule to the `blockIP` ACL that **denies all traffic** originating from the IP range `10.0.0.0` to `10.255.255.255`.
   - The `0.255.255.255` is a **wildcard mask**, which is the inverse of a subnet mask. It defines which bits of the IP address are checked. In this case, it matches any IP address in the `10.0.0.0/8` subnet (which covers `10.0.0.0` to `10.255.255.255`).
   - **Effect**: This rule blocks all traffic from any IP address in the `10.0.0.0/8` network.

3. **Line 553: `permit any`**
   - This command adds a rule that **permits all other traffic** that does not match the `deny` rule.
   - This acts as a catch-all to allow any traffic not explicitly denied by previous rules in the ACL.

### Summary:
- The **`blockIP`** access list denies any traffic from the **10.0.0.0/8** network.
- After that, the ACL allows all other traffic by using the `permit any` rule.
- This ACL can be applied to an interface to control which packets are allowed or blocked based on the source IP addresses. 

If this ACL is applied to an interface, traffic from the `10.0.0.0/8` network will be blocked, and traffic from all other IP addresses will be allowed.

# explain below lines in the upload file
```
access-list 2 permit 10.34.128.0 0.0.0.31
access-list 3 permit 10.34.131.0 0.0.0.31
```
-----

The lines you provided are from your Cisco router configuration file, and they define two **standard access control lists (ACLs)**. Let's break down each line:

### 1. **`access-list 2 permit 10.34.128.0 0.0.0.31`**
   - **`access-list 2`**: This defines a **standard access control list (ACL)** with the number `2`. Standard ACLs allow or deny traffic based on the **source IP address**.
   - **`permit 10.34.128.0 0.0.0.31`**: This line permits traffic from IP addresses in the range of `10.34.128.0` to `10.34.128.31`.
     - The **IP address** `10.34.128.0` is the starting address.
     - The **wildcard mask** `0.0.0.31` specifies which bits of the IP address should be checked. In this case, it allows traffic from any address where the first 27 bits match `10.34.128.0`. This means the range is from `10.34.128.0` to `10.34.128.31`.

   **Effect**: This ACL rule allows traffic from all IP addresses in the range `10.34.128.0` to `10.34.128.31`.

### 2. **`access-list 3 permit 10.34.131.0 0.0.0.31`**
   - **`access-list 3`**: This defines another **standard access control list (ACL)** with the number `3`.
   - **`permit 10.34.131.0 0.0.0.31`**: This line permits traffic from IP addresses in the range of `10.34.131.0` to `10.34.131.31`.
     - The **IP address** `10.34.131.0` is the starting address.
     - The **wildcard mask** `0.0.0.31` specifies that only the last 5 bits of the IP address are not checked, resulting in the range from `10.34.131.0` to `10.34.131.31`.

   **Effect**: This ACL rule allows traffic from all IP addresses in the range `10.34.131.0` to `10.34.131.31`.

### Summary of the Two ACLs:
- **`access-list 2`** allows traffic from the IP range `10.34.128.0` to `10.34.128.31`.
- **`access-list 3`** allows traffic from the IP range `10.34.131.0` to `10.34.131.31`.

These ACLs are most likely used in your NAT configuration or other filtering purposes, allowing traffic from specific IP ranges while potentially denying other traffic.


# give command to modifty access-list 3 to permit only 10.34.131.0 to 10.34.131.5

To modify **access-list 3** to permit only the IP range `10.34.131.0` to `10.34.131.5`, you can either:
- **Remove** the existing entry from the access list and then add the new rule.
- **Edit** the existing entry if supported on your router model.

Here’s the recommended approach for most Cisco routers, which involves removing the existing rule and adding the new one.

### Steps to Modify Access List 3:

1. **Enter Global Configuration Mode**:
   ```
   VMCDR# configure terminal
   ```

2. **Remove the Existing Rule in Access List 3**:
   First, you need to delete the existing permit rule (`10.34.131.0 0.0.0.31`) from access-list 3.
   ```
   VMCDR(config)# no access-list 3 permit 10.34.131.0 0.0.0.31
   ```

3. **Add a New Rule for the Range `10.34.131.0` to `10.34.131.5`**:
   You can now add the new rule to permit only the range `10.34.131.0` to `10.34.131.5`. The appropriate wildcard mask is `0.0.0.7`, which allows a range of 6 IPs (from `.0` to `.5`).
   ```
   VMCDR(config)# access-list 3 permit 10.34.131.0 0.0.0.7
   ```

4. **Exit and Save the Configuration**:
   After adding the new rule, exit configuration mode and save the changes.
   ```
   VMCDR(config)# end
   VMCDR# write memory
   ```

### Explanation:
- **`no access-list 3 permit 10.34.131.0 0.0.0.31`** removes the original rule that permitted the range `10.34.131.0` to `10.34.131.31`.
- **`access-list 3 permit 10.34.131.0 0.0.0.7`** adds a new rule that permits only the IP range `10.34.131.0` to `10.34.131.5`. The wildcard mask `0.0.0.7` allows this small range of IPs.

By applying these commands, **access-list 3** will only permit traffic from the IPs `10.34.131.0` to `10.34.131.5`.
