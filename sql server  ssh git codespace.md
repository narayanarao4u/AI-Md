

Yes, you can connect your GitHub Codespace code to a local SQL Server, but it requires setting up a tunnel between your local machine and the Codespace. Hereâ€™s how you can do it:

---

### **Steps to Connect GitHub Codespace to Local SQL Server**

#### **1. Enable Remote Connections on SQL Server**
- Open **SQL Server Configuration Manager**.
- Go to **SQL Server Network Configuration > Protocols for [Your Instance]**.
- Enable **TCP/IP**.
- Restart SQL Server.

#### **2. Find Your Local Machine's IP Address**
- Open **Command Prompt (cmd)** and type:
  ```sh
  ipconfig
  ```
- Note down your **IPv4 Address**.

#### **3. Allow SQL Server Through Firewall**
- Open **Windows Defender Firewall**.
- Add an **Inbound Rule** to allow TCP traffic on **port 1433**.

#### **4. Set Up an SSH Tunnel from Codespace to Local SQL Server**
- On your **local machine**, start an SSH server. If you donâ€™t have OpenSSH installed, install it first.
- Forward traffic from **Codespace to your local machine**:
  ```sh
  ssh -L 1433:localhost:1433 user@your-local-ip
  ```
  Replace `user` with your local system username.

#### **5. Connect from Codespace to Local SQL Server**
- In your Codespace, install **mssql-cli** or any SQL client:
  ```sh
  sudo apt-get install mssql-tools
  ```
- Use the following connection string in your app:
  ```
  Server=localhost,1433;Database=YourDatabase;User Id=YourUsername;Password=YourPassword;
  ```

### **Alternative: Use ngrok for Secure Tunnel**
If you donâ€™t want to set up SSH, you can use **ngrok**:
1. Download and install ngrok from [ngrok.com](https://ngrok.com/).
2. Run:
   ```sh
   ngrok tcp 1433
   ```
3. Use the provided public address in your Codespace to connect to your local SQL Server.

### **How to Check if the SSH Command is Working on Windows**

Since you are using **Windows**, follow these steps:

---

### **1. Check if OpenSSH is Installed**
Windows 10/11 comes with OpenSSH pre-installed, but you need to verify it:

- Open **Command Prompt (cmd)** and run:
  ```sh
  ssh
  ```
  - If you see SSH command usage details, OpenSSH is installed.
  - If not, install OpenSSH via **Windows Settings > Optional Features**.

---

### **2. Get Your Windows Username**
To find your current Windows username, run in Command Prompt:
```sh
whoami
```
This will return something like:
```
DESKTOP-123ABC\YourUsername
```
Your actual username is **everything after the `\`**.

---

### **3. Start SSH Server on Windows**
To enable SSH on your local machine:

- Open **PowerShell as Administrator** and run:
  ```sh
  Get-Service -Name sshd
  ```
  If the SSH service is **not running**, start it with:
  ```sh
  Start-Service sshd
  ```

- Ensure SSH starts on boot:
  ```sh
  Set-Service -Name sshd -StartupType Automatic
  ```

---

### **4. Test SSH Locally**
Before trying from GitHub Codespace, test SSH on your local machine:

Run:
```sh
ssh YourUsername@localhost
```
- If prompted for a password, enter your **Windows user password**.
- If login is successful, SSH is working.

If you get **"Connection refused"**, check:
- Firewall settings (allow port **22** for SSH).
- That **sshd** service is running.

---

### **5. Try SSH from Codespace**
From your **GitHub Codespace terminal**, run:
```sh
ssh -L 1433:localhost:1433 YourUsername@YourLocalIP
```
- Replace `YourUsername` with your Windows username.
- Replace `YourLocalIP` with your actual **IPv4 Address** (get it by running `ipconfig` in Command Prompt).

If SSH connects successfully, your Codespace can now tunnel requests to your local SQL Server.

---

### **How to Verify the Tunnel Works**
After running the SSH command in your Codespace, try **connecting to SQL Server** from within the Codespace:

```sh
mssql-cli -S localhost -U YourSQLUsername -P YourSQLPassword
```
Or in your applicationâ€™s connection string:
```
Server=localhost,1433;Database=YourDatabase;User Id=YourSQLUsername;Password=YourSQLPassword;
```

If it connects, your Codespace is successfully accessing your local SQL Server! ðŸŽ‰
